A  skeleton django-project that lets people to create a question and vote.For front-end designing I have used  front-end library Bootstrap4. For creating form [django-crispy-forms](https://django-crispy-forms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) was used. [Pygal](http://pygal.org/en/stable/) was used for visualization poll's results.
